**Animal Club in React**

This is a projects that is done by me to understand concepts of React such as UseState, UseEffect, Usereducer and Customhooks etc..

I have used Express.js for backend and Chance.js to generate Dummy data.

This project will look similar to [Phone Book](https://github.com/Anandprabhu530/phone_book.git) project. Custom hooks are being used here.

Also vite is the tool used for react setup.

Step 1:

```
git clone https://github.com/Anandprabhu530/Animal_Club.git
```

Step 2: Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

Step 3: Start the Project

```
npm run dev
```

Step 4: Start the express server

```
cd server
node index.js
```
